## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- The toughest part of this challenge was again, overlaying a color over an image and sizing all of the image related contents. After this challenge, I am more confident on performing a task like this.

```css
div {
  background-image: linear-gradient(
      hsla(273, 100%, 26%, 0.6),
      hsla(273, 100%, 26%, 0.6)
    ), url("images/image-header-desktop.jpg");
  background-size: cover;
  border-top-right-radius: 0.5em;
  border-bottom-right-radius: 0.5em;
}
```
